# Todo List
### Author: @BraydonKains

## General
* Coming up with how I will handle nested structures
	* Curly braces are in first place for now
* Experiment with ; vs \n vs . as line-enders
	* . is the most interesting experiment, but I'm not convinced yet

## grammar.md
* I need a better way to express "any number of valid expressions".
* Reserved type words uppercased or not?
	* I eventually want custom types, so enforcing those as uppercase instead might be more readable
* Do I want the mix type?
