# lucidity

Lucidity is a programming language research project focused on creating a grammar and syntax that is as readable as possible.

## Development

I intend to write an LLVM compiler for the language. This includes writing as many of the steps of that process by hand as possible in Go. This is fueled by a couple things:
* I always thought compiler development was cool
* I love programming language design
* I needed a good way to learn Go
* I'm trying to improve my low-level programming abilities and intend to direct my career in that direction

This may be a ridiculous thing to attempt, but since this is primarily for the sake of learning I really want to give it my best shot.

## Design Philosophy

A few philosophies I am attempting to abide by while designing the language:
* The goal of the grammar is to liken its readability to the English language
* The goal of the syntax is liken its readability to long-standing traditional programming structures
* Verbosity is acceptable where it is in efforts to achieve the above goals
* The language is primarily for research purposes, and will involve experimental syntax or grammars that are likely to fail
