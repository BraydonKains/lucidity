# lucidity

Lucidity is a programming language research project focused on creating a grammar and syntax that is as human-readable as possible.

## Development

I was inspired to take on this project because:
* I always thought compiler and interpreter development was cool
* I love programming language design
* I needed a good way to learn Go
* I'm trying to improve my low-level programming abilities and intend to direct my career in that direction

I am starting by writing an interpreter/runtime for the language. I may decide to write a compiler as well if the experiment goes well. I'm also looking into Lua a bit more, as I always thought what Lua does is cool but really dislike the language. It would be really cool to come up with an alternative that would run in the Lua runtime or something. Not sure how feasible it is yet. :shrug: I guess we'll see!

## Design Philosophy

A few philosophies I am attempting to abide by while designing the language:
* The goal of the grammar is to liken its readability to the English language
* The goal of the syntax is liken its readability to long-standing traditional programming structures
* Verbosity is acceptable where it is in efforts to achieve the above goals for better or for worse
* The language is primarily for research purposes, and will involve experimental syntax or grammars that are likely to fail
